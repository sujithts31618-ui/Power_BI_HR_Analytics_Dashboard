## 🔍 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI, aimed at visualizing key HR metrics using a dummy dataset. The dashboard enables analysis of:

- Gender-wise employee distribution

- Total employee headcount

- Average salary and experience

- Technical skillset distribution

- Educational qualifications and certifications

- Working mode breakdown (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite)

- Employee source (how they joined)

- Interactive time slicers for trend analysis

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop

- MS Excel (for data preparation)

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures

- Power Query Editor for data cleaning

## 🗂️ Dataset (Dummy) from https://mockaroo.com/


The dataset contains the following fields:

- Employee_ID

- Gender

- Salary

- Experience

- Skills (multiple)

- Education

- Certification_Status

- Working_Mode

- Joining_Source

- Company

- Joining_Year

Note: This is a dummy dataset created for learning and demonstration purposes only.


## 🧱 Steps to Build the Dashboard
## 1. 📥 Data Collection / Preparation

- created and imported dummy HR dataset in Excel.

- Ensured fields are clean and consistent (e.g., no nulls in critical fields like Gender, Company, Education).

- Loading the dataset into Power BI.

## 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning in Power Query

- Checked for  duplicates values.

- Correct data types (e.g., Salary as number, Joining Date as Date)
## 3. 🖼️ Adding Company Logos and Images

To enhance the dashboard visually and allow users to filter data by company using images, a separate image table was created.

## 🧱 Steps Taken:

- Created a 2 new table named CompanyImage with fields Company and Company_Image and Companylogo with fields Company and Company_logo

- The table was  created manually and imported from a Excel file.

- Established a relationship between:

    - Main Employee Table[Company] → Company_Image[Company]
    - Main Employee Table[Company] → Company_logo[Company]
- Used the Image URL field in visuals:

  - Set the column Data Category to Image URL (in column tools)

- Used Table visual to display images.

- Used image slicers  to allow dynamic filtering based on the selected company logo

- 🔍 Example Use Case:

    - When a user clicks on a company logo, the dashboard filters all visuals to show only data related to that selected company.

    - The company office image is dynamically shown in a separate card or image visual.

## 3. 📊 DAX

- Gender Count = COUNT(Employee[Gender])
- Headcount = COUNT(Employee[Employee_ID])
- AvgSalary = AVERAGE(Employee[Salary])
- AvgExperience = AVERAGE(Employee[Experience])
## 4. 📈 Report & Visualizations

- created the following visuals:

| Visual Element                    | Type              | Details                             |
